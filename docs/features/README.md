## Documentation Notes 
The model diagrams do not attempt to show every field and relationship.  Instead they try 
to convey the important aspects of the model with regard to the subject being discussed.

In general Waltz does not specify foreign keys as this poses significant issues when 
ingesting data from numerous back-end sources.
